This is the home of the LENA Web Application Server.
LENA provides everything required for creating and configuring Web Application Server so easily.

All feature following will be working with CLI.

The feature of LENA Open Edition : 

+ Core Engine : encrypt datasource password and servlet filter to disable secure attribute of session cookie when set-cookie.

+ Installation : Create, Delete and Clone server. Don't need to type in much things when create server, just required server name and service port.
  Clone server is so useful when you wanna save the status of the server right away.
 
+ Execution : Start, Stop server. You can check the server status just with a command "ps". Just in case, service request is under abnomal status and you need to
              restart the server forcely. Use the command "force restart server_id". 

+ Monitoring : It is possible to capture heap and thread dump using LENA which means that, you don't need to memorize complicated commands like jmap.
               just do that with simple command of LENA.
